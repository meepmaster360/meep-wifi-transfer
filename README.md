Awesome — here is a hybrid version of the Wi-Fi transfer tool that lets you choose:

✅ Local backup & restore

📤 Send/receive via SSH

📁 Copy to/from a USB drive

It's fully menu-driven, with interactive SSH target input and USB detection.

######

Also a combined cross-platform script that you run on the Mac to export Wi-Fi networks & passwords, then automatically send the backup file to the Linux machine via SSH, and run the import on Linux remotely
